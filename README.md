# PurchaseOrder

This project was generated via Angular, nodeJS (I am using v18.16.0) ENV is needed.

## Development server

1. Run `npm install` to install the needed Node packages.
2. Run `npm start` to start a dev server locally. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
2. From there it will talk with Backend (POBackend) application `http://localhost:8080/`.
3. No need to worry about CORS issue, frontEnd (PurchaseOrder) app can handle it.
4. Test files can be found under the project root folder.
1. The application will automatically reload if you change any source files.
2. Any issue, question or comment please contact with lixiaoding07@gmail.com
